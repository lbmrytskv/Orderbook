# OrderBook Visualizer
An Angular web application that allows you to **visually explore and interact with order book snapshots** from a trading system.  
The project provides an intuitive way to **analyze market depth**, **watch bid/ask levels change over time**, and **replay historical snapshots** like a time-lapse.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.3.

## üß™ How to Use

After launching the app (locally or via GitHub Pages):

1. The default snapshot is displayed with a visual breakdown of price levels and sizes.
2. Use the `Prev` / `Next` buttons or the dropdown menu to switch snapshots manually.
3. Click `‚ñ∂ Replay` to watch the order book evolve over time ‚Äî this mimics live market activity.
4. Pause or stop the animation at any moment.

It's perfect for:
- Trading UI prototyping
- Teaching how order books work
- Analyzing how bids and asks respond over time
